1. Real-World Python Dictionary Applications

Objective: The aim of this assignment is to reinforce your understanding and application of Python dictionaries, nested collections, and dictionary methods.

Task 1: Restaurant Menu Update You are given an initial structure of a restaurant menu stored in a nested dictionary. Your task is to update this menu based on given instructions

Problem Statement: Given the initial menu:

restaurant_menu = {
    "Starters": {"Soup": 5.99, "Bruschetta": 6.50},
    "Main Course": {"Steak": 15.99, "Salmon": 13.99},
    "Desserts": {"Cake": 4.99, "Ice Cream": 3.99}
}
- Add a new category called "Beverages" with at least two items.

- Update the price of "Steak" to 17.99.

- Remove "Bruschetta" from "Starters". 

2. Python Programming Challenges for Customer Service Data Handling

Task 1: Customer Service Ticket Tracker Demonstrate your ability to use nested collections and loops by creating a system to track customer service tickets.

Problem Statement: Develop a program that:

Tracks customer service tickets, each with a unique ID, customer name, issue description, and status (open/closed).
Implement functions to:
- Open a new service ticket.
- Update the status of an existing ticket.
- Display all tickets or filter by status.
- Initialize with some sample tickets and include functionality for additional ticket entry.

Example ticket structure:

service_tickets = {
    "Ticket001": {"Customer": "Alice", "Issue": "Login problem", "Status": "open"},
    "Ticket002": {"Customer": "Bob", "Issue": "Payment issue", "Status": "closed"}
}
